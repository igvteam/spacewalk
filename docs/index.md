# Spacewalk Documentation

Spacewalk is an interactive 3D visualization application for super-resolution microscopy data, featuring seamless integration with IGV genomics browser and Juicebox Hi-C map viewer.

**[Launch Spacewalk Application](https://aidenlab.org/spacewalk/)**

## Try It Now

Spacewalk is hosted at [Aiden  Lab](https://aidenlab.org). Launch the app by clicking [here](https://aidenlab.org/spacewalk).

Experience Spacewalk immediately with these demos:

- **[Ball & Stick Demo](https://tinyurl.com/25audeaa)**  
  Chromatin centroids are rendered as balls, each colored according to its genomic location. 
  Sticks (cylinders) connect the balls in the order they appear along the genomic range.

- **[Point Cloud Demo](https://tinyurl.com/23lwr5u6)**  
The point cloud is rendered as a collection of 3D point clusters, each point cluster corresponds to a specific genomic extent and is colored according to the genomic location of that extent.

## Overview

Spacewalk enables scientists to:
- Visualize and explore 3D genomic structures
- Interact with super-resolution microscopy data
- Connect genomic coordinates with spatial organization
- Analyze chromatin folding patterns

## Quick Start

1. Launch [Spacewalk](https://aidenlab.org/spacewalk/)
2. Use the **File** dropdown menu to load your 3D structure
3. Explore your data through our interactive viewers:
   - 3D Structure Viewer
   - Hi-C Map Viewer
   - Genomic Track Viewer

For detailed instructions and features, visit our [User Guide](user-guide).
