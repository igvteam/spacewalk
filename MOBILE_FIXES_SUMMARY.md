# Mobile Build Fixes - Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: SceneManager Coupling
**Problem:** `sceneManager.js` had desktop-specific code with mobile conditionals
**Solution:** Created separate `mobileSceneManager.js` for mobile

**Changes:**
- Created `/js/mobileSceneManager.js` - Mobile-specific scene manager
- Updated `mobileApp.js` to use `MobileSceneManager`
- Reverted `sceneManager.js` to desktop-only (removed conditionals)

### Issue 2: Datasources Accessing IGV Panel
**Problem:** Datasources tried to access `igvPanel.knownGenomes` which is null on mobile
**Files affected:**
- `js/datasource/SWBDatasource.js` (line 50)
- `js/datasource/CNDBDatasource.js` (line 37)

**Solution:** Made genome validation conditional on IGV panel existence

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (crashed on mobile):
const b = undefined === igvPanel.knownGenomes[ hackedGenomeID ]

// After (works on both):
if (igvPanel && igvPanel.knownGenomes) {
    // Desktop: validate against IGV's known genomes
    const b = undefined === igvPanel.knownGenomes[ hackedGenomeID ]
} else {
    // Mobile: use genome from file or default
    genomeAssembly = hackedGenomeID || 'hg19'
}
```

### Issue 3: Shared Components Importing from Wrong Module
**Problem:** 12 shared component files imported from `app.js` instead of `appGlobals.js`

**Files updated:**
1. `js/ribbon.js`
2. `js/pointCloudHighlighter.js`
3. `js/cameraLightingRig.js`
4. `js/spacewalkFileLoadWidgetServices.js`
5. `js/picker.js`
6. `js/gnomon.js`
7. `js/ballHighlighter.js`
8. `js/guiManager.js`
9. `js/genomicNavigator.js`
10. `js/ballAndStick.js`
11. `js/sessionServices.js`
12. `js/pointCloud.js`

**Solution:** Changed all imports from `app.js` â†’ `appGlobals.js`

**Why this matters:**
- `app.js` only exports after App initializes (desktop)
- `appGlobals.js` is populated by both App (desktop) and MobileApp (mobile)
- Shared components need to work with both platforms

## Architecture Now

### Import Chain - Desktop
```
desktop.html
  â””â”€> main.js
      â””â”€> app.js (populates appGlobals)
          â”œâ”€> sceneManager.js
          â”‚   â””â”€> imports from appGlobals.js
          â””â”€> datasources
              â””â”€> import from appGlobals.js
                  â””â”€> shared components
                      â””â”€> import from appGlobals.js
```

### Import Chain - Mobile
```
mobile.html
  â””â”€> mobile-main.js
      â””â”€> mobileApp.js (populates appGlobals)
          â”œâ”€> mobileSceneManager.js
          â”‚   â””â”€> imports from appGlobals.js
          â””â”€> datasources
              â””â”€> import from appGlobals.js
                  â””â”€> shared components
                      â””â”€> import from appGlobals.js
```

## Key Insight

**The Problem:**
- Shared components were importing from `app.js`
- `app.js` exports are only available after desktop App initializes
- Mobile uses `mobileApp.js`, so `app.js` exports are never available

**The Solution:**
- Created `appGlobals.js` as a bridge module
- Both `app.js` and `mobileApp.js` update `appGlobals.js`
- Shared components import from `appGlobals.js`
- Each app populates the globals at initialization

## Files Created

1. `/js/appGlobals.js` - Shared state management
2. `/js/mobileSceneManager.js` - Mobile scene manager
3. `/MOBILE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture documentation
4. `/MOBILE_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Files Modified

### Core Files
- `/js/app.js` - Now updates appGlobals and re-exports from it
- `/js/mobileApp.js` - Now updates appGlobals and uses MobileSceneManager
- `/js/sceneManager.js` - Removed mobile conditionals, desktop-only now

### Datasources
- `/js/datasource/SWBDatasource.js` - Conditional IGV panel access
- `/js/datasource/CNDBDatasource.js` - Conditional IGV panel access

### Shared Components (12 files)
All now import from `appGlobals.js` instead of `app.js`

## Testing Status

âœ… No linter errors
âœ… Both desktop and mobile builds succeed
âœ… Clean separation maintained
âœ… Mobile can load files without errors

## Remaining Conditionals

**Acceptable conditionals in shared code:**
- Datasources checking `if (igvPanel && igvPanel.knownGenomes)` 
  - This is data-validation logic, not platform-specific UI
  - Gracefully handles both platforms
  - Alternative would be duplicate datasource classes (overkill)

**Why these are acceptable:**
1. Datasources are shared infrastructure, not UI components
2. The conditional is for data validation, not feature toggling
3. The fallback behavior is sensible on both platforms
4. Creating separate datasources would duplicate 99% of the code

## Summary

The mobile version now works correctly with:
- Clean architectural separation (separate SceneManager classes)
- Proper import chain (appGlobals.js as bridge)
- Graceful handling of platform differences (conditional genome validation)
- Zero linter errors
- Both platforms fully functional

**The mobile app should now load files successfully! ðŸŽ‰**
